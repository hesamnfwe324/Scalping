## KNOWN DOCUMENTED ISSUES (not blockers)

| ID | Issue | Blocker? | Resolution |
|----|-------|----------|-----------|
| D-01 | eaGenerator.ts CONF_HARD_MIN=85 vs live 70 | ❌ No | Dev tool only; documented in README |
| D-02 | eaGenerator.ts CONF_MARGINAL_MIN_RR=2.0 vs live 1.5 | ❌ No | Dev tool only; documented in README |
| D-03 | WYCKOFF_MAX_RANGE_PCT in config.py never read | ❌ No | Informational calibration record |
| D-04 | Procfile covers robot only, not panel | ❌ No | render.yaml covers both; Render is primary deployment |
| D-05 | robot/package-lock.json absent | ❌ No | Dev tool; npm install is operator responsibility |
| D-06 | Double-entry on abrupt disconnect (C-02) | ❌ No | Requires live test; broker SL/TP protects open positions |
| D-07 | Balance fallback 10,000 (C-01) | ❌ No | Only active during MetaAPI balance fetch failure |
| D-08 | Synthetic backtest data (C-03) | ❌ No | backtestEngine.ts marked NOT for production use |
| D-09 | Persistent storage on Render (ephemeral filesystem) | ❌ No | Operator action — attach persistent disk per DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md |

## FIXES APPLIED IN THIS VERIFICATION PASS

| ID | Fix | File | Trading Impact |
|----|-----|------|----------------|
| V-01 | Created `tests/conftest.py` | `tests/conftest.py` (new) | None |
| V-02 | Created `pytest.ini` with pythonpath=. | `pytest.ini` (new) | None |
| V-03 | PANEL_ENCRYPTION_KEY blank → placeholder in .env.example | `telegram_panel/.env.example` | None |

## SIGN-OFF MATRIX

| Phase | Fixes Applied | Strategy Changes | Score |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (initial audit) | 9 | 0 | 27/50 |
| Phase 2 (blocker resolution) | 11 | 0 | 43/50 |
| Phase 3 (final verification) | 3 | 0 | 46/50 |

*Remaining 4/50 gap: persistent storage (operator action), health endpoint (infrastructure), Procfile panel entry (deployment preference), package-lock.json (dev tool)*
