"""
mt5rest HTTP Connector – GoldScalperPro v4

Direct MT5 connection via the mt5rest Docker bridge (no MetaAPI cloud).
Runs fully self-hosted on Render.

Required env vars:
    MTAPI_URL     – URL of the mt5rest Docker service
                    e.g. https://goldscalper-mtapi.onrender.com
    MT5_HOST      – broker server name  (e.g. AMarkets-Demo)
    MT5_USER      – MT5 account login number
    MT5_PASSWORD  – MT5 account password

mt5rest endpoints used:
    GET  /ConnectEx        – authenticate with broker, returns UUID conn id
    GET  /Disconnect       – close connection
    GET  /ConnectionStatus – check live connection
    GET  /AccountSummary   – balance, equity, margin
    GET  /OpenedOrders     – open positions
    GET  /PriceHistoryV2   – OHLCV candles (ISO datetime range)
    GET  /GetQuote         – current bid/ask price
    GET  /Ping             – liveness probe

    Connect to MT5 via the mt5rest HTTP bridge using GET /ConnectEx.
    Returns the connection UUID which is stored in _conn_id.

    SECURITY FIX: credentials were previously sent as GET query parameters
    (?user=…&password=…), which causes them to appear verbatim in:
      • mt5rest server access logs (every inbound request line is logged)
      • Any reverse proxy or CDN access logs between Render services
      • Browser / curl history when debugging locally
      • Potentially Render's own request logging infrastructure

    Fix: MT5_USER and MT5_PASSWORD are now passed as an HTTP Basic Auth
    Authorization header instead. The mt5rest bridge accepts Basic Auth on
    /ConnectEx as a credential-delivery alternative to query params.

    If the mt5rest version deployed does not support Basic Auth on /ConnectEx
    (older versions only accept query params), the call falls back to the
    original query-param method with a warning emitted to the log — so the
    connection still succeeds but the operator is notified to upgrade the bridge.
