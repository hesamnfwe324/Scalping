Multi-Timeframe (HTF) Filter — GoldScalperPro v4

Computes a Higher TimeFrame directional bias by reusing the existing
Trend, SMC, Wyckoff, and Regime engines on HTF candles (default H1).
The live loop uses this bias as an additional trade gate:

  • Only BUY entries allowed when HTF bias is BUY.
  • Only SELL entries allowed when HTF bias is SELL.
  • NEUTRAL bias → no filter applied (both directions pass through).

Design principles:
  • Zero risk: any fetch/analysis error → NEUTRAL → trade is NOT blocked.
    MTF failure can never stop a valid M5 trade; it only ever blocks bad ones.
  • Additive: zero changes to any existing signal engine or decision logic.
    This module is a pure add-on — it imports from the existing engines but
    never modifies them.
  • Fail-safe precedence: Trend must be non-NEUTRAL for a bias to be issued.
    If Trend is neutral but SMC has a strong signal, we stay NEUTRAL rather
    than issuing a bias from SMC alone (SMC is noisier on higher timeframes
    without the EMA anchor).
  • Conflict suppression: if Trend and SMC actively disagree, bias = NEUTRAL.
    A conflicted HTF means the market is transitioning — we do not filter.
  • Configurable: MTF_ENABLED / MTF_TIMEFRAME / MTF_CANDLE_WINDOW env vars.
  • Transparent: all reasoning is recorded in MtfBias.reasoning for logging
    and panel display.

Typical usage (inside live_loop._on_new_bar):

    htf_candles = await fetch_candles(SYMBOL, MTF_TIMEFRAME, MTF_CANDLE_WINDOW)
    htf_bias    = compute_mtf_bias(htf_candles)          # never raises
    allowed, reason = mtf_allows_trade(htf_bias, decision.direction)
    if not allowed:
        log.info(f"MTF BLOCK: {reason}")
        return

    """
    Derive the HTF directional bias from Trend + SMC + Regime analysis.

    NEVER raises — any exception produces a NEUTRAL bias (fail-safe).
    Returns NEUTRAL when data is insufficient or engines conflict.

    Parameters
    ----------
    htf_candles : list of OHLCV
        Closed candles on the HTF (e.g. H1).  Callers should pass at least
        200 bars so the trend engine can compute EMA-200 reliably; 300 is
        the recommended default (MTF_CANDLE_WINDOW env var).
    timeframe : str
        The timeframe label for the HTF candles (e.g. "H1", "H4").
        Passed to analyze_smc_structure() and analyze_wyckoff() so they
        use calibrated thresholds for the actual candle size instead of
        the hardcoded M5 defaults.  Defaults to "H1" (the normal HTF).

    Returns
    -------
    MtfBias
        Always non-None.  Check .direction for BUY / SELL / NEUTRAL.

    CRITICAL FIX: the previous call omitted timeframe from analyze_smc_structure()
    and analyze_wyckoff(), so both used M5-scale parameters on H1 candles.
    M5 thresholds (e.g. fvg_min_size=0.10, spring_margin=0.20) are ~10–15×
    too tight for H1 bodies, causing SMC and Wyckoff to return NEUTRAL on
    virtually every H1 bar — making the MTF filter a no-op in practice.
