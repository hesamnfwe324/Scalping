"""
Multi-Timeframe (HTF) Filter — GoldScalperPro v4

Computes a Higher TimeFrame directional bias by reusing the existing
Trend, SMC, Wyckoff, and Regime engines on HTF candles (default H1).
The live loop uses this bias as an additional trade gate:

  • Only BUY entries allowed when HTF bias is BUY.
  • Only SELL entries allowed when HTF bias is SELL.
  • NEUTRAL or RANGE HTF → entry blocked.
  • An unavailable HTF bias → entry blocked (fail-closed).
  • The entry must have at least 60% confidence and two confirmed
    timeframes (the HTF plus the active entry timeframe).

Design principles:
  • Safety first: any fetch/analysis error → NEUTRAL → trade is blocked.
    A missing HTF confirmation must never be treated as approval.
  • Additive: zero changes to any existing signal engine or decision logic.
    This module is a pure add-on — it imports from the existing engines but
    never modifies them.
  • Fail-safe precedence: Trend must be non-NEUTRAL for a bias to be issued.
    If Trend is neutral but SMC has a strong signal, we stay NEUTRAL rather
    than issuing a bias from SMC alone (SMC is noisier on higher timeframes
    without the EMA anchor).
  • Conflict suppression: if Trend and SMC actively disagree, bias = NEUTRAL.
    A conflicted HTF means the market is transitioning — entry is blocked.
  • Configurable: MTF_ENABLED / MTF_TIMEFRAME / MTF_CANDLE_WINDOW env vars.
  • Transparent: all reasoning is recorded in MtfBias.reasoning for logging
    and panel display.

Typical usage (inside live_loop._on_new_bar):

    htf_candles = await fetch_candles(SYMBOL, MTF_TIMEFRAME, MTF_CANDLE_WINDOW)
    htf_bias    = compute_mtf_bias(htf_candles)          # never raises
    allowed, reason = mtf_allows_trade(htf_bias, decision.direction)
    if not allowed:
        log.info(f"MTF BLOCK: {reason}")
        return
