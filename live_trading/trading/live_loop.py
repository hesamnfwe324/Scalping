"""
Live Trading Loop — async M5 candle-close event handler via mt5rest bridge.

Flow per tick:
  1. Wait for next M5 candle close
  2. Fetch 300 closed candles via mt5rest bridge
  3. Run decision engine (all 7 signal engines)
  4. Gate: RiskGuardian circuit breakers (daily loss / drawdown)
  5. Gate: max open positions + trade allowed + Telegram not paused
  6. Place order via mt5rest executor (with slippage control)
  7. Write robot_state.json for Telegram panel

Resilience improvements over baseline:
  • RiskGuardian — daily loss limit + peak drawdown stop, both configurable
    via env vars.  Guardian halts block trade entry without stopping the loop.
  • Exponential backoff — reconnect delay doubles on each consecutive failure
    (cap: 5 minutes) then resets to base on success.
  • Slippage control — SLIPPAGE_POINTS env var limits max fill deviation.
  • Trade-history persistence — trade log is restored from robot_state.json
    on startup, so the Telegram panel shows history after a restart.
  • Duplicate-entry safety — live MT5 position check already prevents
    double-entry (unchanged), but now also guarded by Guardian state.

        Restore trade history from the last written robot_state.json, falling

        ROOT-CAUSE FIX: On Render, STATE_FILE lives on the service's ephemeral
        filesystem — every deploy/restart starts from a clean container, so
        the local JSON file is empty right after any restart. Without this,
        _known_open_tickets() (used to repair mt5rest's corrupted phantom-row
        volume/type fields — see connector._dedupe_positions) would also come
        back empty right after a restart, silently reopening the exact
        blind-spot the phantom-row fix targets until this session logs a
        brand-new trade itself. Redis (REDIS_URL) is the durable cross-service
        copy already used for guardian-state restore; merging it in here
        closes that gap. Falls back to file-only, then empty, if Redis is
        unavailable — no behavior change from before in that case.
